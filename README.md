# FCFS_calci
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduler
This repository contains an implementation of the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm in [programming language].

Overview
The FCFS scheduling algorithm is a simple scheduling algorithm that schedules tasks based on the order they arrive in the ready queue. It is non-preemptive, meaning once a process starts executing, it continues until it finishes.

Features
Simple implementation of the FCFS scheduling algorithm
Easy-to-understand code structure
